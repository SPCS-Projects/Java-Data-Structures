# Java Data Structures Exploration - NIDS Projects

Explore Java data structures with this series of projects focusing on Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS). The projects gradually enhance the capabilities of a NIDS by delving into various Java data structures and algorithms.

## Project Overview

The series consists of four projects, each building upon the previous one to explore different aspects of Java data structures. The primary goal is to understand and implement the fundamentals of Java data structures.

### Purpose

The projects aim to provide hands-on experience with Java data structures and algorithms, emphasizing their application in real-world scenarios. The project gave insight into linked lists, stacks, and other essential data structures used in network security.

### Usage

1. Open each project in your Java development environment.

2. Execute the main method of the relevant class for each project.

3. Follow project-specific instructions provided in individual README files.

### Project Structure

- **Project 1:** Introduces the basics of linked lists for organizing network packets in ascending order based on TCP sequence numbers. The NIDS inserts and manages packets, ensuring the ascending order is maintained.

- **Project 2:** Expands on the linked list implementation, addressing packet timestamping and separation. Timestamped packets are inserted into different stacks based on urgency, demonstrating enhanced packet management.

- **Project 3:** Continues work on the NIDS, introducing packet prioritization. Packets are assigned priorities, and the NIDS processes them using a priority queue. Students implement the priority queue in the PrioritizedNetworkTraffic class.

- **Project 4:** Concludes the series by enhancing the NIDS to analyze computers in a large enterprise network. The NIDS uses a binary search tree to meet specific requirements, and students implement tree traversal orders (In order, Pre-order, Post-order) in the TreeNode class.

### Running Each Project

Refer to the respective README files for each project within their designated folders for detailed instructions on running and understanding the output.
