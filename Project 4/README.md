# Project 4 - Computer Analysis with Binary Search Tree

The final project extends the NIDS to analyze computers within a large enterprise network. The NIDS employs a binary search tree to meet specific requirements: analyzing all computers and ensuring equal frequency of analysis.

## Running the Project

1. Open the project in your Java development environment.
2. Execute the `WorkerClass` main method.
3. Observe the traversal of the binary search tree in different orders for comprehensive computer analysis.
