# Project 3 - Packet Prioritization with Priority Queue

Project 3 continues the development of the NIDS by introducing packet prioritization. Each network packet is now assigned a priority, representing its level of urgency for processing. The NIDS utilizes a priority queue to process packets, giving precedence to those with higher priorities. The project includes two classes: `IDSWorkerClass` and `PrioritizedNetworkTraffic`.

## Running the Project

1. Open the project in your Java development environment.
2. Execute the `IDSWorkerClass` main method.
3. Observe the prioritization and processing of packets using the implemented priority queue.
